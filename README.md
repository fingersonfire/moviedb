moviedb
=======

A personnal movie database written in PHP/MySQL

It's a friendly fork of php4dvd 2.0 (http://php4dvd.sourceforge.net/) due to the lack of update.

<b>Features</b>

Search IMDb.com for movie information and store this detailed information (like directors, actors, poster, language...)
More information per movie like personal notes, if you own or have seen the movie, loaned it out, etc...
Add covers to your movies
Powerful and quick search function
User login
Multiple languages
Very configurable, easy to use
Layout is based on a template which you can easily adjust

<b>Requirements</b>

To use these files you need to have a php installation:

* Apache 2 or higher
* Php 5.3 or higher
* GD2 library to be able to upload (and resize) covers
* MySQL 5.0 or higher

<b>Download</b>

For now, you'll have to clone the repository or download master branch. 
I'm trying to keep it running properly on each commit .

<b>Installation</b>

Read the instructions in docs/README.TXT to install or upgrade.
